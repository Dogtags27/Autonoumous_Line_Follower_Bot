# Autonoumous_Line_Follower_Bot
As a member of NoobDroidz team participating in the Track-O-Quest competition held by Cyborg, we built a Autonomous Line and Edge Follower Bot.
The Autonomous Line and Edge Follower bot can autonomously detect lines and edges with the use of 8-array IR-sensors and shift between Black-line follower, White-line follower and Edge follower modes. The bot involves the use of basic electronic and robotics components like Arduino-Nano , Buck Convertor, Driver Module (LN-298N) and self-built IR-sensors.
The bot was able to detect the changes in color and effectively correct its course to stay on track. The logic provided to the Arduino is in the following code file.
